# Remote Central
Need access to your primary desktop for a long time but run into issues (random freezes, IP changes, etc)?

Remote Central will help you with this endeavour by syncing your desktop/s with a central server. This will let you keep track of online machines and issue commands as needed.

## Setting up

You will need a server to sync your desktop/s with. Anything that can run Linux will do. Ideally it will have a static IP or domain so your computers will never have trouble connecting.
